Each example reside in a different branch:
1. A simple application that use IEnumerable with Iterator
2. IAsyncEnumerable with Iterator
3. LINQ with System.Linq.Async
4. Adding async Select
5. Cancellation - WithCancellation, [EnumeratorCancellation]
6. ConfigureAwait
7. Using System.Interactive.Async and the Buffer operator
8. Moving between async streams and Rx (and vice versa) - CombineLatest operator
9. Moving between async streams and Rx (and vice versa) - Merge operator
